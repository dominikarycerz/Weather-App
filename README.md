# Weather App
Simple weather app that shows weather in the city selected by the user.

Data are collected from the Weather API (OpenWeatherMap).

### Motivation
Created during the course on Udemy in order to practice API.

## Things I've learned

- Making GET requests
- Using Body Parser to Parse POST Requests
